# Bird-Species-Classification

This project is to classify the bird species given Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 image dataset. It is a multi-class classification problem. The training images can be found in Train.zip folder, and the annotation file can be found in train.txt. The testing images in the Test.zip folder and the annotation file in test.txt as well.

The assignment require us to use two models to solve the problem. The first model I used is Convolutional Neural Network approach, and the second one is using transfer learning from a pre-trained network, which is MobileNet V2.

This project is only for assignment purpose.
